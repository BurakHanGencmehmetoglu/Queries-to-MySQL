I established connection to the MySQL server using JDBC and send queries according to database schema and required operations.

Database schema is :
-> User(userID:int, userName:varchar(30), email:varchar(30), password:varchar(30), status:varchar(15))
-> Video(videoID:int, userID:int, videoTitle:varchar(60), likeCount:int, dislikeCount:int, datePublished:date)
-> Comment(commentID:int, userID:int, videoID:int, commentText:varchar(1000), dateCommented:date)
-> Watch(userID:int, videoID:int, dateWatched: date)


Required operations :
• Creating the database tables
• Inserting data into tables
• List videos which have higher likeCount than dislikeCount
• List videos commented by the given userID
• Find the oldest published video for a given user which doesn’t contain ’VLOG’ in its title
• List the trending top three videos for a given time interval (detailed explanation is given below)
• List users and number of videos watched only by her/him
• List users who have watched and commented all of their own videos
• List the users that has at least one watch but no comments
• Update the users’ status to ”verified” if the view count of all their videos in total is more than the given number
• Given a video id and a string, update the title of the video with the given id to the new string
• Given video title, delete that video from the database
• Dropping the database tables
